# Themed Hangman Game
A programming languages themed hangman game with player input feedback registering the number of instances of a correctly found letter as well as the remaining letters to be found. 

## Key Features 

1. Incorrectly selected letters are greyed out. Correctly selected letters appear accordingly with a tally showing number of remaining spaces to be filled.

 ## Things learnt/practiced:
 
 1. The Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle to properly randomise an array.
 2. Using the forEach method for cycling through letters when building the appropriate amount of blanks to fill.
 
 
## Challenges I overcame: 

1. Populating the letters to the right blanks took some figuring out, but was eventually fixed by appending the child div to the appropriate querySelector.
